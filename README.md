# PlantDatabase
Small school project (server programming). SpringBoot+Maven+JPA+h2+Thymeleaf+Bootstrap. A database to store/add/edit info of my many plants. WIP.
This project is deployed <a href="https://houseplant-manager.herokuapp.com/login">here</a> on Heroku (give it a few moments to wake up). The login credentials are admin/admin and user/user.

There are two versions, master-branch for the demo app on Heroku, plantdbmaria-branch modified to work with my local MariaDB database.
